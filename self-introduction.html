  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    I am well-equipped to handle complex challenges or demanding circumstances with proven experiences such as leadership and troubleshooting skills. <br>

In my role, I currently specialize in resolving various software, hardware, and mechanical issues related to the Semiconductor Abatement System, at client sites. <br>
I excel in solving complex problems, even under high pressure, such as when facing clients within tight time constraints.
  </p>
  <p> 
  In addition, with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Systems Engineering and a Computer Science minor, my wide breadth of engineering skills allows me to refine my problem-solving skills, and present outcomes to be a successful leader. 

  During my student years, I frequently participated in hackathons. I always set a detailed plan to win an award before the event started. Given the limited time, completing the most compelling project efficiently was crucial. As a team leader, I optimized efficiency further by assigning each team member roles aligned with their specialized skills, allowing us to concentrate on tasks. As a result, I achieved my goal of "winning an award" by the final day.
